# prediction-of-house-prices
With 80 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa in USA, the aim here is to predict the sale price of each home.

Therefore, we will practice feature engineering and regression algorithms to achieve the lowest prediction error (RMSE is the metric used in a such competition).
